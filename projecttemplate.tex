\textbf{Summary of the dataset}: * we have 1599 object and 13 variable
at which 11 of them are features that describes quality of wine * it
turns out that the max quality of wine reaches 8.0 and no quality is
higher than that, while the average quality is 5.635

\section{Univariate Plots Section}\label{univariate-plots-section}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Make sure that you leave a blank line between the start /
end of each code block and the end / start of your Markdown text so that
it is formatted nicely in the knitted text. Note as well that text on
consecutive lines is treated as a single space. Make sure you have a
blank line between your paragraphs so that they too are formatted for
easy readability.
\end{quote}

\section{Univariate Analysis}\label{univariate-analysis}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Now that you've completed your univariate explorations,
it's time to reflect on and summarize what you've found. Use the
questions below to help you gather your observations and add your own if
you have other thoughts!
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{What is the structure of your
dataset?}\label{what-is-the-structure-of-your-dataset}

\subsubsection{What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your
dataset?}\label{what-isare-the-main-features-of-interest-in-your-dataset}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{What other features in the dataset do you
think will help support your\\
investigation into your feature(s) of
interest?}{What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?}}\label{what-other-features-in-the-dataset-do-you-think-will-help-support-your-investigation-into-your-features-of-interest}

\subsubsection{Did you create any new variables from existing variables
in the
dataset?}\label{did-you-create-any-new-variables-from-existing-variables-in-the-dataset}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Of the features you investigated, were
there any unusual distributions?\\
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change
the form\\
of the data? If so, why did you do
this?}{Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data?

\section{Bivariate Plots Section}\label{bivariate-plots-section}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what
relationships between variables might be interesting to look at in this
section? Don't limit yourself to relationships between a main output
feature and one of the supporting variables. Try to look at
relationships between supporting variables as well.
\end{quote}

\section{Bivariate Analysis}\label{bivariate-analysis}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: As before, summarize what you found in your bivariate
explorations here. Use the questions below to guide your discussion.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Talk about some of the relationships you
observed in this part of the\\
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other
features in\\
the
dataset?}{Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation.

relationships between the other features\\
(not the main feature(s) of
interest)?}{Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?}}\label{did-you-observe-any-interesting-relationships-between-the-other-features-not-the-main-features-of-interest}

\subsubsection{What was the strongest relationship you
found?}\label{what-was-the-strongest-relationship-you-found}

\section{Multivariate Plots Section}\label{multivariate-plots-section}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what
you found in the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate
plots to investigate more complex interactions between variables. Make
sure that the plots that you create here are justified by the plots you
explored in the previous section. If you plan on creating any
mathematical models, this is the section where you will do that.
\end{quote}

\section{Multivariate Analysis}\label{multivariate-analysis}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Talk about some of the relationships you
observed in this part of the\\
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms
of\\
looking at your feature(s) of

\subsubsection{Were there any interesting or surprising interactions
between
features?}\label{were-there-any-interesting-or-surprising-interactions-between-features}

your dataset? Discuss the\\

\section{Final Plots and Summary}\label{final-plots-and-summary}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: You've done a lot of exploration and have built up an
understanding of the structure of and relationships between the
variables in your dataset. Here, you will select three plots from all of
your previous exploration to present here as a summary of some of your
most interesting findings. Make sure that you have refined your selected
plots for good titling, axis labels (with units), and good aesthetic
choices (e.g.~color, transparency). After each plot, make sure you
justify why you chose each plot by describing what it shows.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Plot One}\label{plot-one}

\subsubsection{Description One}\label{description-one}

\subsubsection{Plot Two}\label{plot-two}

\subsubsection{Description Two}\label{description-two}

\subsubsection{Plot Three}\label{plot-three}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\section{Reflection}\label{reflection}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Here's the final step! Reflect on the exploration you
performed and the insights you found. What were some of the struggles
that you went through? What went well? What was surprising? Make sure
you include an insight into future work that could be done with the
dataset.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Don't forget to remove this, and the other \textbf{Tip}
sections before saving your final work and knitting the final report!
