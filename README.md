# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Work
In this project, I will analyze the Red Wine Data and try to understand which variables are responsible for the quality of the wine. First I will try to get a feel of the variables on their own and then I will try to find out the correlation between them and the Wine Quality with other factors thrown in. Finally I will create a linear model to predict the outcome of a test set data.
